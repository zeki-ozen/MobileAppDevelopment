# React Native Network & API Communication Notes

Markdown content set prepared to accompany a React Native lesson that builds on Expo's Blank (JavaScript) template. Each file explains a core networking concept, highlights the most important patterns, and provides two sample use cases that work on Expo Snack.

## File Structure
- [FetchAPI.md](FetchAPI.md) - Native Fetch API for HTTP requests
- [Axios.md](Axios.md) - Promise-based HTTP client library
- [AsyncAwait.md](AsyncAwait.md) - Modern asynchronous JavaScript patterns
- [ErrorHandling.md](ErrorHandling.md) - Handling network errors gracefully
- [RESTfulAPIs.md](RESTfulAPIs.md) - Working with RESTful endpoints
- [LoadingStates.md](LoadingStates.md) - Managing loading and UI states

## Usage Tips
- When building dedicated example screens for each concept inside `App.js`, start from the code snippets in these notes.
- During the lesson, review the concept overview first, then run through the sample code live.
- To try the examples on Expo Snack, simply copy the code into a new snack at [snack.expo.dev](https://snack.expo.dev).
- All examples use free public APIs that don't require authentication.
